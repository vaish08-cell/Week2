Data Cleaning and Transformations in Power Query Editor
•Power Query Editor in Power BI Desktop allows you to shape (transform) your imported data. You can accomplish actions such as renaming columns or tables, changing text to numbers, removing rows, setting the first row as headers, and much more. It is important to shape your data to ensure that it meets your needs and is suitable for use in reports.
•You have loaded raw sales data from two sources into a Power BI model. Some of the data came from a .csv file that was created manually in Microsoft Excel by the Sales team. The other data was loaded through a connection to your organization's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.

Data Cleaning and Transformations in Power Query Editor
•To start shaping your data, open Power Query Editor by selecting the Transform data option on the Home tab of Power BI Desktop.

•In Power Query Editor, the data in your selected query displays in the middle of the screen and, on the left side, the Queries pane lists the available queries (tables).
•When you work in Power Query Editor, all steps that you take to shape your data are recorded. Then, each time the query connects to the data source, it automatically applies your steps, so your data is always shaped the way that you specified.

Remove top rows: When shaping your data, you might need to remove some of the top rows, for example, if they are blank or if they contain data that you do not need in your reports.
Remove top rows: To remove these excess rows, select Remove Rows > Remove Top Rows on the Home tab.
Remove columns: A key step in the data shaping process is to remove unnecessary columns.
You can remove columns in two ways. The first method is to select the columns that you want to remove and then, on the Home tab, select Remove Columns.
Remove Duplicates:
•Select all the Columns>>>Go to Home Tab >>>Remove Rows>>>Remove Duplicates
